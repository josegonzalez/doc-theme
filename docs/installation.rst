Setup
=====

* You will need to install the `cakephp_theme` package:

.. code-block:: shell

    # from pypi
    pip install cakephp_theme

    # from github
    pip install -e git+https://github.com/cakephp/doc-theme/#egg=cakephp_theme



* Add the following to your ``conf.py`` so the theme location is loaded:

   .. code-block:: python

        import cakephp_theme

        html_theme_path = [cakephp_theme.get_path()]
        html_theme = 'cakephp_theme'


* Add an explicit ``html_context`` setting so the theme's
  customized attributes are properly initialized:
   
   .. code-block:: python
    
        html_context = {
            'maintainer': 'Your Name',
            'project_pretty_name': 'Your Project Name',
            'projects': {
                'CakePHP Book': 'https://book.cakephp.org/',
                'Some other project': 'https://example.com/',
            }
        }

That's it! You now have the CakePHP documentation theme set up.
